# ColourCorrection
Firecapture plugin applies colour correction matrix to Bayer data to correct crosstalk with OSC cameras. 

You can download compiled matrices of most popular one shot colour planetary camera sensors to have them preconfigured with this file (which will be hidden due to being a . file once downloaded): .firecapture_colour_matrices.properties

These matrices assume a colour capture with a UV/IR blocker or luminance filter with a bandwidth of approximately 400-680nm.
